##uSafe?  
uSafe? is an iOS application that helps keep you safe no matter where you go or what you do. It's especially useful for those who live alone.  
How it works:  
Register for an account in our app, and add a few people as your emergency contacts. Once they have agreed, you can choose a task (ie jogging), an emergency contact and the amount of time you will spend on this task. Once you start this task, our app will send a text message to your emergency contact about your task and when will this task end. If you as the user have not checked back in on our app after the given amount of time, our app will send a text message to your contact reminding them to check in with you to make sure you are safe. We will also implement a location tracker if you did not check back in after the task.
